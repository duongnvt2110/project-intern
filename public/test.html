		</b>
		You will not be charged sales tax for any order shipped outside the state of Maryland. This is due to a government mandate that says online retailers are only liable for paying sales tax on orders within their home state. We are based in Maryland. So&nbsp;
		<span>If you ship to any of the lower 48 states or Washington D.C., we commit to passing these savings on to you for as long as the legislation lasts. (Any orders shipped to Maryland will be charged the standard 6% sales tax.)
